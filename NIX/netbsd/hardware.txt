Would you like me to make a **second variant of this build** (e.g., a slightly **lower-budget** or **lower-power version**) while keeping ECC + virtualization support?




Here‚Äôs a summary of the build for the [ASUS‚ÄØPro‚ÄØWS‚ÄØWRX90E‚ÄëSAGE‚ÄØSE]() motherboard ‚Äî adapted to fit your use-case (virtualization host + home workstation for watching movies/listening to music). I‚Äôll highlight where it‚Äôs better (and where to adjust) compared to the previous build option.

## üîç Board overview & relevant specs

* Socket: AMD sTR5 ‚Äî supports AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7000 WX‚ÄëSeries and later. ([ASUS Global][1])
* Chipset: AMD WRX90. ([ASUS Global][2])
* Memory: 8 √ó DIMM slots, **8-channel memory architecture**, supports DDR5 and ECC Registered memory. ([ASUS Global][2])
* Storage: 4 √ó M.2 (PCIe 5.0 x4) + 2 √ó SlimSAS + SATA ports. ([ASUS Global][2])
* Expansion: 6 or 7 √ó PCIe 5.0 x16 slots (depending on variant) for multi-GPU or heavy add-ons. ([ASUS Global][1])
* Networking: Dual Intel 10 GbE ports on board + 1√ó1 GbE management. ([ASUS Global][2])
* On-board WiFi: **None built-in** (you‚Äôll need a separate WiFi module). ([TriFi  Tech][3])
* Form factor: SSI EEB (very large) ‚Üí full tower case required. ([ASUS Global][2])

---

## ‚úÖ Fit for your use-case & pros

* Excellent for your virtualization workload: supports ECC, huge memory channels, high expandability ‚Üí gives you strong headroom for host + 4 VMs.
* Great for home workstation / media: lots of PCIe lanes means you can add GPU, sound card, NVMe pool, network cards without bottleneck.
* Top-tier networking built-in (10 GbE) is a big plus if you have a good network/infrastructure at home or want VM traffic separation.
* ECC and workstation grade hardware means reliability for research use.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to watch / adjust

* Board is **very large**, so you‚Äôll need a spacious case (E-ATX/EEB) with good cooling.
* WiFi is **not built-in** ‚Äî you‚Äôll want to install a WiFi 6/6E module (e.g., Intel AX210) in M.2 Key-E slot.
* As a high-end board, cost will be higher vs slightly simpler boards (so budget accordingly).
* If you‚Äôre not expecting to use 7 PCIe slots, you might be paying for more than you need‚Äîbut that‚Äôs acceptable if you expect growth.
* Ensure BIOS supports all features you need (IOMMU, ECC, virtualization) and update to the latest version.

## üîÆ Estimated Budget

Since this board is top of the line, expect premium pricing:

* Motherboard itself: high end (often ‚Ç¨1400+ or equivalent) ([Accelerator][4])
* Build total with CPU, RAM, GPU etc could put you in the ‚Ç¨4500-‚Ç¨5500 range depending on parts/pricing.
* If budget is tighter you could reduce RAM or pick a lower GPU‚Äîbut you‚Äôd still benefit from the board‚Äôs capabilities.

If you like, I can **pull the current Israeli/European pricing** (parts available in Israel) for this exact build (board + CPU + RAM) so you can check shipping/taxes and compare. Would you like that?
