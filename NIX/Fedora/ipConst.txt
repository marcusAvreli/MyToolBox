IP packet forwarding
or
1. compile a kernel with options GATEWAY, 
or
2. you can sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 each time your machine boots
or
3. put net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 into /etc/sysctl.conf



echo "192.168.134.152 netmask 255.255.255.0 media autoselect" >> /etc/ifconfig.wm0


Here are the diagnostic steps I have performed so far:
----------------------------------------

1. ifconfig -a --> sip0 is up, connected, and has the right IP, broadcast 
and netmask.

2. netstat -rn --> Internet routing table is fine.

3. ping sup.netbsd.org --> FAILS w/ DNS error.

4. ping 4.2.2.1 (nameserver) --> FAILS.  DNS is busted because I can't talk 
to the nameservers.  Diagnose this:

5. traceroute to my nameserver (4.2.2.1) --> FAILS.  See below:

This is the output from a Windows machine on the same physical wire and also 
configured via DHCP.  It works:

Tracing route to 4.2.2.1 over a maximum of 30 hops

  1    60 ms    30 ms    40 ms  4.33.176.1
  2    20 ms    30 ms    30 ms  4.24.124.9
  3    20 ms    30 ms    30 ms  4.24.5.101
  4    20 ms    30 ms    30 ms  4.24.5.98
  5    30 ms    20 ms    20 ms  4.2.2.1

This is the output from the failing NetBSD machine:

traceroute to 4.2.2.1 (4.2.2.1), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
1  4.33.176.1  28.862 ms  33.648 ms  32.797 ms
2  4.24.124.9  23.488 ms  22.826 ms  22.898 ms
3  4.24.5.101  22.961 ms  22.817 ms  23.237 ms
4  4.24.5.98  23.262 ms  23.255 ms  23.521 ms
5  4.24.22.6  23.808 ms *  25.584 ms

Note that the LAST hop is WRONG.  This is WIERD, but I don't think this 
explains the "Cannot assign requested address" problem, because traffic is 
actually generated (see step 10 below).

Note also that my other machines hit the last hop just fine, as does my 
NetBSD 1.2 machine (also configured by DHCP).

6. Take DNS out of the picture since we know something's wrong with it; 
comment out all lines in resolv.conf.

7. traceroute to sup.netbsd.org (added to /etc/hosts temporarily):

traceroute to sup.netbsd.org (204.152.184.75), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
1  4.33.176.1 (4.33.176.1)  26.621 ms  36.534 ms  30.305 ms
2  4.24.124.9 (4.24.124.9)  23.054 ms  22.950 ms  22.969 ms
3  4.24.5.101 (4.24.5.101)  23.232 ms  30.740 ms  23.104 ms
4  4.24.9.173 (4.24.9.173)  41.824 ms  42.041 ms  42.196 ms
5  4.24.7.58 (4.24.7.58)  42.124 ms  41.751 ms  43.545 ms
6  4.0.3.198 (4.0.3.198)  42.202 ms  42.125 ms  42.845 ms
7  4.0.85.5 (4.0.85.5)  43.337 ms  43.241 ms  43.597 ms
8  209.133.31.177 (209.133.31.177)  43.793 ms  44.259 ms  43.166 ms
9  207.126.96.54 (207.126.96.54)  43.522 ms  50.622 ms  42.964 ms
10  216.200.0.10 (216.200.0.10)  47.183 ms  47.471 ms  47.055 ms
11  204.152.184.193 (204.152.184.193)  47.145 ms  48.015 ms  52.559 ms
12  204.152.184.179 (204.152.184.179)  194.383 ms  247.447 ms  249.312 ms
13  sup.netbsd.org (204.152.184.75)  47.266 ms  47.665 ms  47.546 ms

...SUCCESS!  I now know that I can get off-subnet and that this is not a 
problem with the DHCP-supplied routing information.

Can I sup to the machine, since I can traceroute to it?

8. sup -s -v
SUP 8.26 (4.3 BSD) for system software at Jan  4 01:03:20
SUP: Can't connect to server for supfilesrv: Can't assign requested address

9. Is the problem specific to sup?  Can I connect to other hosts using other 
programs?

>telnet 129.186.1.201
Trying 129.186.1.201...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Can't assign requested address

>ftp 204.152.184.75 (ftp.netbsd.org)
ftp: connect: Can't assign requested address

...No.  Looks like everyone who calls connect() has this problem.  Could the 
problem be routing (maybe connect() is returning the wrong error)?  
Connect() to a machine on the local net:

>telnet <windows machine temporarily running telnet>
Connected to <windows machine>
Escape character is '^]'.
Welcome to Microsoft Telnet Service
login:

So it works when I do it locally, just not out in internetland.

10.  tcpdump and find out what could be happening on the wire when I try to 
sup:

>tcpdump -i sip0 not tcp port telnet &
tcpdump: listening on sip0

>sup -s -v
SUP 8.26 (4.3 BSD) for system software at Jan  4 01:25:21
SUP: Can't connect to server for supfilesrv: Can't assign requested address

[wait several minutes to make sure, but NO TRAFFIC IS GENERATED]

...so the problem isn't routing (because traceroute works), isn't my ISP 
(because no traffic happens when it fails), isn't my netcard (because 
traceroute works and the problem doesn't repro locally).  What am I missing?
