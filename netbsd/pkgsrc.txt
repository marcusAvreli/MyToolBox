3.1. Getting pkgsrc for the first time
3.1.2. Via anonymous CVS
	cd /usr && cvs -q -z2 -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot checkout -P pkgsrc
	
	cd /usr/pkgsrc/bootstrap
	./bootstrap

	Refer to documentation on your command shell how to set CVS_RSH=ssh permanently. For Bourne shells, you can set it in your .profile 
	or better globally in /etc/profile:

		# set CVS remote shell command
		CVS_RSH=ssh
		export CVS_RSH

	By default, CVS doesn't do things like most people would expect it to do. But there is a way to convince CVS, by creating 
	a file called .cvsrc in your home directory and saving the following lines to it. This file will save you lots of headache and some bug reports, 
	so we strongly recommend it. You can find an explanation of this file in the CVS documentation.

	# recommended CVS configuration file from the pkgsrc guide
		cvs -q
		checkout -P
		update -dP
		diff -upN
		rdiff -u
		release -d
